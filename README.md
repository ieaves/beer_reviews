# beer_reviews
Contained is a dataset consisting of 1.5 million beer reviews from beeradvocate.com

Document your thinking process as you attempt to answer these questions. Include any plots used to support your answers and provide the code, either packaged with the analysis as a markdown or notebook file or separately in a code file.  Please also export your notebook and submit as PDF. Complete the work using any open source programming language with statistics capabilities (e.g. R, python, scala, java, Octave, Julia. No SQL or SAS derivatives).


### Questions to answer using the data:

1. Which 5 breweries produces the strongest beers by ABV%? Alcohol by volume (abbreviated as ABV) is a standard measure of how much alcohol is contained in a given volume of an alcoholic beverage.
2. If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?
3. Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?

### Additional math/coding question unrelated to the data:

A die is sold for cheaters which has 6 faces that are weighted unevenly so that the probability of rolling each number is not uniform. The probability of rolling each number is given in the table below:

| #   | Probability |
| --- | ----------- |
|  1  |     0.34    |
|  2  |     0.18    |
|  3  |     0.05    |
|  4  |     0.18    |
|  5  |     0.13    |
|  6  |     0.12    |

Generate 10,000 samples using only a built-in uniform random number generator (and no other packages), from the distribution above. Explain why your approach works and illustrate with graphic(s) where appropriate.
